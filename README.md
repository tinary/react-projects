# react-projects
 
I made a couple of projects to get familiar with the React framework.

## Projects
1. **place-finder-app-express:** Learned to call 3rd-party API to fetch data and display information based on user submitted data. [(See Project)](https://github.com/tinary/react-projects/tree/master/place-finder-app-express)
2. **todolist-main:** Created a basic todo app for managing daily tasks. [(See Project)](https://github.com/tinary/react-projects/tree/master/todolist-main)
